# Uber-fare-Prediction

Ride-sharing services like Uber have revolutionized transportation by providing convenient and affordable rides. As a data scientist, your task is to predict the fare amount of future rides using regression analysis. By accurately estimating the fare amount, ride-sharing companies can optimize pricing strategies, provide transparency to riders, and ensure fair compensation for drivers.

The fare amount of a ride is influenced by various factors such as distance, duration, traffic conditions, time of day, and demand. Your goal is to develop a regression model that can predict the fare amount based on these factors. You will work with a dataset that includes historical ride data, including the fare amount and relevant features.

In this project, you will build a regression model to predict the fare amount of future rides. Your model should be trained on historical ride data and evaluated using appropriate metrics. Additionally, you will provide insights and recommendations based on the model's predictions.
